# Stack3D
The fastest method of Sprite Stacking in Gamemaker!

(As a benchmark, using this technique I can have 1500 sprite stacked models drawing at once at 60 fps. Using normal sprite stacking I can have about 200 at 60 fps.)

Stack3D is a small library for Gamemaker Studio 2 that lets you make Sprite-Stacking style games using actual 3d functionality. You can read how to use it here: https://dev-dwarf.github.io/dwarfdev/tutorials/2021/01/24/Stack3D-Guide.html

The demo project has everything you need to get started with using the system. Read the guide to figure out how to use it! If you have changes or improvements to suggest, feel free to make a pull request!
