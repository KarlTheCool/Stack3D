Hello! This is a message from me, dev_dwarf, who created this example project.

In the readme I want to give some explanation and advice. It also shows that the project is available under the MIT
License (Which allows you to freely use it in your own work, with or without attribution). That said, I'd love a 
shout out, or even for you to just send me what you've done with it!

If you need help, or want to suggest changes, please reach out on twitter (@dev_dwarf) or discord (https://discord.gg/5URwf82)

You can read an up to date guide on using the system here: https://dev-dwarf.github.io/dwarfdev/tutorials/2021/01/24/Stack3D-Guide.html
